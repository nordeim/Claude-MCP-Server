Yes — based on everything we’ve traced through the `MCPBaseTool` contract and the way `server.py`’s own **synchronous** `get_tool_info()` aggregates tool metadata, you should remove the `async` prefix from **all** of those tool‑level `get_tool_info` methods.  

Here’s why that’s the correct move:

---

### 1. **Interface & Call Chain**
- `MCPBaseTool` does **not** define `get_tool_info` at all, so there’s no async requirement from the base class.
- `mcp_server/server.py` defines its own `get_tool_info(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]` as a **sync** method, which will be calling each tool’s `get_tool_info()` directly.
- If any tool’s `get_tool_info` is async, the server will receive a coroutine object instead of a `dict` — breaking JSON serialization and downstream logic.

---

### 2. **Nature of the Method**
- All these `get_tool_info` implementations are just building and returning static metadata dictionaries.
- There’s no I/O, no awaits, and no need for concurrency control — async adds no benefit here.

---

### 3. **Consistency & Safety**
- Keeping them all synchronous ensures:
  - Uniform method signatures across all tools.
  - No accidental coroutine leakage into sync aggregation code.
  - No need to refactor `server.py` or upstream consumers.

---

### ✅ Action
Change each of these:

```python
async def get_tool_info(self) -> dict:
```

to:

```python
def get_tool_info(self) -> dict:
```

in:
- `mcp_server/tools/gobuster_tool.py`
- `mcp_server/tools/hydra_tool.py`
- `mcp_server/tools/masscan_tool.py`
- `mcp_server/tools/sqlmap_tool.py`

(`nmap_tool.py` is already correct.)

---

Got it — that extra grep result is actually quite telling.  

Here’s what it means for your original question about making `get_tool_info` in `nmap_tool.py` async:

---

## 1. What we now know
- `mcp_server/server.py` **already** defines its own `get_tool_info(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]` at line 251.
- That method is **not** async — it’s a plain `def`.
- This strongly suggests that the server’s `get_tool_info` is a synchronous aggregator that likely loops over all registered `MCPBaseTool` instances and calls their `get_tool_info()` methods directly.
- If we make `NmapTool.get_tool_info` async, then `server.py`’s sync `get_tool_info` would be calling an async method without `await`, which would return a coroutine object instead of a `dict`. That would break the aggregation logic and likely cause runtime errors (e.g., `TypeError: Object of type coroutine is not JSON serializable`).

---

## 2. Why async would break here
- In Python, calling an `async def` from sync code without `await` just returns a coroutine object — it doesn’t run the function.
- Since `server.py`’s `get_tool_info` is sync, it cannot `await` without being rewritten as async itself.
- That would mean **changing the entire call chain** — including any upstream consumers — to async, which is a breaking change.

---

## 3. Conclusion
Given the current architecture:
- **Keep `NmapTool.get_tool_info` synchronous**.
- There’s no I/O or awaitable work in it anyway — it’s just building a metadata dictionary.
- Making it async would require refactoring `server.py` and any other synchronous consumers.

---

## 4. Recommendation
Leave it as:
```python
def get_tool_info(self) -> dict:
    ...
```
If in the future you truly need async (e.g., to fetch live metrics from an async source), you’d need to:
1. Change `server.py`’s `get_tool_info` to `async def`.
2. Update all call sites to `await` it.
3. Possibly provide a sync wrapper for backward compatibility.

---

### Verdict

Do not prefix line 164 with async. Keep get_tool_info synchronous.

---

### Why

- Interface contract: MCPBaseTool does not declare get_tool_info at all, so there’s no base-class requirement to make it async.
- Core usage: The grep output shows no references to get_tool_info in the core (server) files. That strongly suggests there’s no established async call path expecting to await it. Making it async would return a coroutine to any existing synchronous callers and silently break them.
- Nature of method: The method returns static metadata without I/O. Async adds overhead and complexity without benefits.

---

### Safe options

- Keep it synchronous (recommended):
```python
def get_tool_info(self) -> dict:
    ...
```

- If you need an async call site later, provide a non-breaking shim while preserving the sync API:
```python
def get_tool_info(self) -> dict:
    return {...}

async def get_tool_info_async(self) -> dict:
    return self.get_tool_info()
```

This preserves compatibility for all current synchronous consumers and offers a clean async path if needed later.
