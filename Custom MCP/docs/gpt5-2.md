### Patch validation

Your sed patch looks correct, and the grep confirms the change was applied uniformly across all tool files.

- **Command correctness:** The substitution targets the exact token sequence `async def get_tool_info(self) -> dict:` and replaces it with the synchronous form. No regex meta-characters that could misfire. The `-i` in-place edit is appropriate for multiple files.
- **Post-change verification:** The grep output shows every `get_tool_info` is now synchronous in gobuster, hydra, masscan, nmap, and sqlmap. That matches the intended scope and leaves nmap unchanged (already sync).

### Potential edge cases to double-check

- **Whitespace variants:** If any file had minor formatting differences (e.g., double spaces, trailing spaces, different return annotation spacing, or a trailing comment), the sed match wouldn’t hit those. Your grep output suggests all targets matched, but still run a safety scan:
  - Search for any remaining async versions:
    - grep -Rn "async def get_tool_info" mcp_server/tools
    - grep -Rn "async[[:space:]]\+def[[:space:]]\+get_tool_info" mcp_server/tools
- **Decorators:** Ensure no decorators exist above get_tool_info that assume an async function. A quick scan:
  - grep -Rn "@.*get_tool_info" mcp_server/tools
- **Call sites awaiting:** Remove any awaits against these methods:
  - grep -Rn "await .*get_tool_info" mcp_server
  If any appear, convert to plain calls.

### Follow-up sanity checks

- **Type check:** Run your type checker (e.g., mypy/pyright) to catch any places still expecting Awaitable[dict].
- **Runtime smoke test:** Start the server and invoke the endpoint or code path that aggregates tool info to ensure it returns proper JSON and not coroutine objects.
- **Consistency:** Ensure base classes or interfaces (if any) don’t specify async. From earlier review, they don’t.

Direct answer: Yes, your sed application is correct as shown by the grep results. Run the quick scans above to guard against formatting variants or stray awaits.
