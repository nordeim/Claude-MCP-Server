## Overview

The Security MCP Server is a robust, production-ready implementation that bridges Claude Desktop with powerful security tools. It provides a secure framework for running security assessments, network scans, and vulnerability tests through a controlled, audited environment.

### Why This Matters

Security testing requires specialized tools and careful control to prevent unintended consequences. This MCP server provides:

- **Safe Execution**: All tools are executed in a controlled environment with strict security constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging and monitoring of all security operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents network overload and aggressive scanning
- **Access Control**: Restricts operations to authorized targets only (RFC1918 and .lab.internal)
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevents cascading failures and system overload

### MCP Integration

This server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows Claude Desktop to securely interact with external tools and resources. The MCP architecture ensures:

- **Standardized Communication**: Consistent interface between Claude and tools
- **Security Isolation**: Tools run in isolated environments
- **Resource Management**: Controlled access to system resources
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities

## Features

- **Claude Desktop**: Latest version with MCP support
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### Security Tools
The following security tools are included in the Docker image:
- `gobuster` v3.6+
- `hydra` v9.4+
- `masscan` v1.3+
- `sqlmap` v1.7+

### Knowledge Requirements
- Basic understanding of security testing concepts
- Familiarity with Docker and containerization

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nordeim/Security-MCP-Server.git
cd Security-MCP-Server
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the template:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Server Configuration
MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
MCP_SERVER_PORT=8080
MCP_SERVER_TRANSPORT=http

# Security Configuration
MCP_SECURITY_MAX_ARGS_LENGTH=4096
MCP_SECURITY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
MCP_SECURITY_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=2

# Metrics Configuration
MCP_METRICS_ENABLED=true
MCP_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
MCP_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_PORT=9090

# Logging Configuration
MCP_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
MCP_LOGGING_FILE_PATH=/var/log/mcp/server.log
```

### 3. Start the Server

Using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image with all security tools
- Start the MCP server
- Configure metrics collection
- Set up logging

### 4. Verify the Server

Check that the server is running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see the `security-mcp-server` container running.

### 5. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the MCP server to Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings → Developer → MCP Servers
3. Add a new server with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "security": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "security-mcp-server", "python", "-m", "mcp_server.main"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Test the Integration

Restart Claude Desktop and test with a simple prompt:

```
Can you help me scan my local network for open ports using masscan? I want to scan the 192.168.1.0/24 network for ports 80, 443, and 22.
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Security Assessment

```
I need to perform a security assessment on my local web server at http://192.168.1.10. Can you:
1. Use gobuster to discover directories and files
2. Use sqlmap to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
3. Provide a summary of findings
```

### Network Scanning

```
Please scan my local network (192.168.1.0/24) for:
1. Open web servers (ports 80, 443, 8080)
2. SSH servers (port 22)
3. FTP servers (port 21)
Use masscan for the initial scan and then use more targeted tools for any discovered services.
```

### Password Security Testing

```
I need to test the password security on my local SSH server at 192.168.1.10. I have a list of usernames in /path/to/users.txt and passwords in /path/to/passwords.txt. Can you use hydra to test these credentials? Please limit the thread count to 4 and stop when you find a valid credential.
```

### SQL Injection Testing

```
I have a web application at http://192.168.1.10/login.php with a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the username parameter. Can you use sqlmap to test this? Please use risk level 1 and test level 2 to be safe.
```

### Comprehensive Security Audit

```
I need a comprehensive security audit of my local network. Please:
1. Scan the 192.168.1.0/24 network for common services
2. For any web servers found, discover directories and test for SQL injection
3. For any SSH servers found, test for weak credentials using my wordlists
4. Provide a detailed report of all findings
```

### Custom Tool Configuration

```
I need to run a custom gobuster scan with specific parameters:
- Target: http://192.168.1.10/admin
- Wordlist: /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
- Threads: 20

### Workflow Triggers

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by:
- **Push to main branch**: Runs tests and deploys to production
- **Push to develop branch**: Runs tests only
- **Pull requests to main**: Runs tests and security scans

### Quality Gates

The workflow includes several quality gates:
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure all tests pass
- **Security Scan**: Check for security vulnerabilities
- **Docker Build**: Verify the Docker image builds correctly
- **Integration Tests**: Verify MCP server functionality
