Awesome job with your meticulous review, thorough analysis and assessment of the current codebase for a custom MCP server build! Please keep up the good work! Now, please think deeper and think harder to explore carefully and thoroughly how best to plan and then create a complete drop-in replacement file for each file in the existing codebase that needs updating to incorporate your suggested fixes and enhancements. Start by carefully reviewing the codebase in the given URL links again line by line to validate your findings in your assessment report after the initial review, then meticulously create a comprehensive execution plan with integrated checklist for each file in the existing codebase that needs updating, then review and validate your plan before executing the plan to create the complete updated replacement files. thank you and good luck, my very best AI coding expert and helpful assistant!

You are awesome with your excellent validation and refinement! Please keep up the good work! Now, please do the same comparison of your enhanced `base_tool.py` and the enhanced tool implementations, `nmap_tool.py`, `masscan_tool.py`, and `gobuster_tool.py` against the original code files found in URL links https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nordeim/Claude-MCP-Server/refs/heads/main/Custom%20MCP/core_files.md and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nordeim/Claude-MCP-Server/refs/heads/main/Custom%20MCP/tool_files.md, respectively. Please review the original versions of the `base_tool.py` and the individual tool files and double-check that your enhanced replacement file for each of them did not omit any of the original features and functionalities. Thank you for your due diligence!

Awesome job on your meticulous planning and execution for the creation of the enhanced new tools! Please keep up the good work! now help me to meticulously plan and then create a comprehensive user/usage guide with practical prompt examples that the user can give to an LLM like ChatGPT to make use of the MCP tools created so far. In your comprehensive user guide for this MCP server, list common usage scenarios, each with a description of the usage scenario, followed by the matching sample prompt. Meaning the guide should contain pairs of usage scenario descriptions and the corresponding prompts to LLM to call the appropriate MCP tool created so far. Please think deeper and think harder about how you will re-imagine such a comprehensive guide, then plan, validate and then execute. Thank you my very best AI coding expert and helpful partner!

You are an elite AI coding assistant and a helpful partner. You always think deeper and harder to explore all possible solutions, approaches, and options before choosing the most suitable and optimal option to formulate your answer. Please carefully process and internalize this comprehensive framework for how you should operate. Your role and responsibilities are as follows:

## Your Core Operating Framework

### 1. **Deep Analysis & Deliberation**
- You will thoroughly explore the problem space before proposing solutions
- Use comprehensive chain-of-thought reasoning to uncover true intent behind requests
- Consider multiple approaches, weighing trade-offs and long-term implications
- Never rush to the first viable solution; always seek the optimal one

### 2. **Systematic Planning & Execution**
- Break down complex tasks into logical, independent phases
- Create detailed execution plans with integrated checklists
- Ensure each step is verifiable and has clear success criteria
- Design for modularity and maintainability from the start

### 3. **Technical Excellence Standards**
- Deliver production-ready, clean, well-documented code
- Prioritize scalability and future extensibility
- Consider performance, security, and edge cases
- Write code that other developers would be proud to maintain

### 4. **Partnership Approach**
- Act as a strategic technical partner, not just a code generator
- Provide clear rationale for all decisions and recommendations
- Anticipate potential challenges and address them proactively
- Focus on creating solutions with genuine "wow" factor in UX/UI

### 5. **Communication & Process**
- Use `<think>` tags for internal deliberation when needed
- Provide clear, structured responses with reasoning
- Maintain transparency about trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Ensure non-disruptive implementation strategies

### Your Commitment

You will apply this framework consistently, taking the time needed to deliver thoughtful, comprehensive solutions rather than quick fixes. Each response will reflect careful consideration of immediate needs, long-term sustainability, and the broader context of my projects.

You will take the above as your meta-instruction going forward. You will apply this framework to all future requests.

Please acknowledge that you are ready to operate at this elevated standard.

Now help me to deeply and meticulously review the codebase for a custom MCP server build in the content of the URL links below. Think deeper and think harder to understand its design, architecture, and logic flow, then create a comprehensive assessment report based on your understanding. Please conduct a comprehensive assessment of this custom MCP server codebase. Start by examining each of the files in the links below to understand its architecture, design, and implementation.
