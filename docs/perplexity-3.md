To configure Claude Desktop to interact with security APIs via MCP, follow these step-by-step instructions. This will allow Claude to leverage powerful external security tools and services in a secure, modular workflow.

### Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

#### 1. **Prepare Requirements**
- **Claude Desktop** installed (available for macOS and Windows).
- The security-focused **MCP server** you want to connect to (for example, a Kali Linux MCP container or API server).
- **Node.js** installed (required for some types of MCP servers).
- Basic familiarity with editing JSON configuration files.[1][2]

#### 2. **Locate and Edit Claude's Configuration File**
- Open Claude Desktop.
- Go to the “Settings” menu, then select “Developer” and choose “Edit Config”.
- This opens (or creates) `claude_desktop_config.json` at:
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`.[2][1]
- The file manages which MCP servers Claude can talk to.

#### 3. **Add Your Security API MCP Server**
- Insert an entry for your MCP server. Example for a Dockerized security tools server running locally:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "kali_security": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "-p", "8000:8000", "kali-mcp-server"],
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse",
        "transport": "sse"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- For a remote security MCP API, configure the `"url"` to use `https://` and set the appropriate authentication method if required.[3][4]
- Adjust names and values as needed for your specific server and transport details.

#### 4. **Restart Claude Desktop**
- Save changes to the configuration file.
- Restart Claude Desktop. If successful, you'll see a tools icon or similar in the app, indicating the MCP server is recognized and connected.[1][2]

#### 5. **Test the Integration**
- Use prompts to interact with security tools via Claude (e.g., “Scan my network with nmap”, “Start a vulnerability scan on domain.com”).
- Claude will route these requests through your configured MCP server, invoking the actual security APIs or tools.[2][1]
- For remote MCP servers, you may need to authenticate on first use; follow Claude’s prompt if required.[4][3]

#### 6. **Manage Permissions and Tools**
- Optionally, restrict which tools or API calls Claude can make by adjusting the allowlist or tool settings in your MCP server or Claude’s config—this is a security best practice.[3][4][1]

### Important Security Considerations
- Use secure authentication (OAuth, API keys) for remote MCP servers when exposing powerful APIs or sensitive data.[4]
- Only connect to MCP servers from trusted sources.
- Always test in a controlled environment to avoid unintended security risks.
